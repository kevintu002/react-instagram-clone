## Why did I make this?

I wanted a project to utilize Firebase for the backend and React for the frontend. Firebase handles most of the user authentication and database management. React allows the client browser to receive a live and interactive experience with posts and comments without needing to refresh the page.

## How do I use it?

You can create an account, which will automatically sign you in, and start making your own posts to the app.

Don't want to make an account? Feel free to use the guest account found in the sign in/up button.
